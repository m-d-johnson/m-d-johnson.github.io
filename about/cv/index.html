<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Experienced DevOps engineer and Linux system administrator with cloud experience on GCP.  I have a particular interest in High Performance Computing for researchers and engineers.  Free software proponent.</p>

<p><strong>Professional experience</strong></p>

<p><strong>May 2014 to Nov 2019:    SRE - Systems Engineer (ex. DevOps, ex SA) - DeepMind, Google Health UK</strong></p>

<p>I designed, built, developed, and maintained the infrastructure and platform for DeepMind Health - built on Linux, running Docker and Kubernetes, and isolated from the Google production network. For the first three years, I took responsibility for the datacentre, procurement, hardware, and OS deployment configuration as well as the networking and security requirements.  I then worked on the project to move this project to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).<br />
I also project managed, planned, and built the on-site infrastructure for the AlphaGo events in China and South Korea. I ensured that the events had the necessary hardware, infrastructure, and networking resources available for the event to not only go ahead but also to be monitored effectively, withstand problems, and deliver live streams of both events to the world.
Both of the above projects required network administration using Cisco ASA and Brocade VDX series equipment.
Outside of this, my work at DeepMind has included: Supporting researchers with their research computing needs.  Designing and building new GPU/CPU HPC clusters.  Storage administration.  Integrating with the wider Google infrastructure including building on GCP.  Use of Nagios, Ganglia, Zabbix, Bash, Puppet, Ansible, Kapitan.  Designing and building automated builds and hardening procedures.  Planning for expansion and analysing future business needs, particularly for research computing and support services.  Managing datacentre environment.  General support and advice to developers.  Mentoring new employees as they integrate.   Basic to intermediate bash/Python scripting.  Administering FreeIPA, ElasticSearch, Veeam, and other services.
I also have a deep interest in Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity.  A member of a few ERGs, I have been actively involved in team and group DE&amp;I activities and have actively participated in their planning and execution.</p>
