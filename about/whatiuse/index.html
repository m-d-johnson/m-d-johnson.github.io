<p>Inspired by (copied from) several others, I thought I&rsquo;d have a go at putting some notes together on what I use day-to-day.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://zen-of-programming.com/uses/">Ali Spittel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wesbos.com/uses/">Wes Bos</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jessicadembe.tech/uses/">Jessica Dembe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bencodezen.io/uses/">Ben Hong</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1150921910827413504">a Twitter thread started by Sarah Drasner that I spotted in July 2019.</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a software engineer, and I never have been.  My current job title is &lsquo;Systems Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer&rsquo;, but most of my career has been spent answering to &lsquo;System Administrator&rsquo;.</p>

<p>While there are similarities to the software engineeer toolset, I think there&rsquo;s a job-specific difference as well.  Although we all aspire to &lsquo;config as code&rsquo;, we still inevitably have to jump around different machines once in a while. I subsribe to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principle of Least Astonishment</a>, so I tend to avoid the hyper-customised and optimised environments my software engineer colleagues tend to favour.</p>

<h2 id="the-physical-a-desk-chair-and-laptop-macbook-pro-2018">The Physical: A desk, chair, and laptop. (Macbook Pro 2018)</h2>

<p>I use a height-adjustable desk, which allows me to adjust for comfort and use a standing desk if I want.  I usually work sitting down.  The chair is whatever work has given me.  I&rsquo;m at my twelfth desk in five years due to rapid growth in the company, so getting too attached to a single desk chair is pointless.</p>

<p>Macbook Pro 2018, 13-inch, 16GB RAM.  I returned to using a Mac about six months ago.  I&rsquo;d used a 2009 model Macbook and gone back to Thinkpads after I wore it out, but after an X220 and an X250 I thought I&rsquo;d have another go.  It was a good call, as though the Thinkpads are still good pieces of kit, the Macbook Pro is a formidable tool for the IT professional.</p>

<p>I also have a scanner and shredder.  I don&rsquo;t object to having paper mail, and indeed when many places require bank statements or utility bills as proof of address they&rsquo;re useful.  I do scan as much as possible with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HQCBH3F/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_W2ClDbCTTZYJ3">Fujitsu ScanSnap ix1500</a> and then the originals go into a shredder which utterly destroys them.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>

<p>This is the subject of much debate.  I was the first in my office to jump in and buy a mechanical keyboard in the office, and now everyone&rsquo;s at it.  I use the <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/code-keyboard/code-104-key-mechanical-keyboard.html">WASD Code Keyboard</a> with Cherry MX Clear switches and O-rings to keep the noise down and be considerate to my office-mates.  Everyone else is happy to make the noise.  One day, I&rsquo;ll bring in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">Model M</a>.</p>

<h2 id="watch">Watch</h2>

<p>Withings <a href="https://www.withings.com/uk/en/steel-hr">&lsquo;Steel HR&rsquo;</a>:  Tells you your heart rate, steps, stairs, calories burned, and even the current time.</p>

<h2 id="phone">Phone</h2>

<p>Samsung <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s9/">Galaxy S9+</a>:  I don&rsquo;t really like mobile phones in general, but it&rsquo;s sort of necessary to have one.  I find the Samsung ones annoy me least.</p>

<h2 id="tablet">Tablet</h2>

<p>Samsung <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/tablets/galaxy-tab-s3/">Galaxy Tab S3</a>:  It&rsquo;s a tablet, innit?  I use it mainly for Kindle, Netflix, and as a hard surface when I need to write something.</p>

<h2 id="operating-system-mac-os-10-14-mojave-https-www-apple-com-uk-macos-mojave">Operating System: <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/mojave/">Mac OS 10.14 Mojave</a></h2>

<p>Here we go.  Operating system doesn&rsquo;t bother me.  Maybe fifteen or twenty years ago it was worth having arguments over why Linux was better than Mac and everything was better than Windows, as of 2019 they&rsquo;re all perfectly capable and dependable.  I happily jump between the three on a day-to-day basis.  It&rsquo;s true that Windows still has a questionable release from time to time, and that Linux can need a bit more nerd points if you want to do something out of the ordinary, but all of them allow me to achieve what I want to achieve on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I also dick about with

+ <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>

and anything else that looks interesting.  It&rsquo;s fun.  Don&rsquo;t judge me.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The very nature of my work means that from time to time I have to work in different environments.  It&rsquo;s true, some like to argue that since everything is DevSecGitChatOps in the Cloud these days and you only need to write code.  Those people can still be found looking for an SSH client when something needs to be debugged or fixed.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-emulation-and-ssh-clients">Terminal Emulation and SSH clients</h2>

<p>I like iTerm2 with the openssh client on the mac as a terminal emulator.  On Windows, MobaXterm has been a solid choice for the past several years as PuTTY&rsquo;s development stalled.  MobaXterm is feature-rich, stable, and well worth the money I spent on a professional licence.  Windows recently added functionality allowing you to use openssh tools and bash natively, but there&rsquo;s a little way to go before they&rsquo;re as easy as on Linux or MacOS.</p>

<p>On Linux, gnome-terminal and the openssh client is perfectly suited to what I do.  It&rsquo;s our go-to for connecting to remote hosts, customisable, secure, and fast.</p>

<h2 id="file-transfer">File Transfer</h2>

<p>In terms of file transfer, Transmit on the Mac is exceptional.  On Windows, FileZilla is still a solid choice if you don&rsquo;t want to use the built-in functionality in MobaXterm.  On Linux, rsync is the standard, except when you need the capability to transfer from, to, or between, cloud services.  Then, rclone is spectacular.</p>

<h2 id="note-taking">Note-taking</h2>

<p>I really like Evernote for non-work related note-taking. It&rsquo;s an easy to use tool which has had a lot of thought put into UX.  I couple it with Grammarly to compensate for my state comprehensive education.  Recently, though, I&rsquo;ve been playing with using Markdown for everything, and using <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> now I&rsquo;ve moved to Mac OS and become comfortable with being a stereotype.</p>

<h2 id="writing-configs-and-code">Writing configs and code</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> is my choice on all three platforms. It&rsquo;s a fast, easy to use text editor, and it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using to write this page.  I used to use Atom, but found it so bloated and slow that I abandoned it.  Remotely, for ad-hoc applications, vim is my choice over emacs.  Sorry.  I&rsquo;m not sorry.</p>

<h2 id="web-and-email">Web and Email</h2>

<p>Chrome and Thunderbird.  Because I work for Google, my personal email resides off Google&rsquo;s infrastructure to avoid tricky situations.  Thunderbird is a mature, battle-hardened open-source project.  I do sometimes switch back to Firefox if I need a &lsquo;clean&rsquo; browser or have weird proxy settings to use or something.  If I&rsquo;m out of the UK, often I&rsquo;ll leave Firefox configured to use a proxy back in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>I use WhatsApp, Skype, Facetime, and Facebook Messenger just like everyone else.  I even make and receive telephone calls on occasion.  I use Signal for private communication with other individuals who understand it and value it.  You should also use Signal.  I use ZoIPer as a VOIP endpoint on all the stuff I own which gives me a London landline number anywhere I am.  It&rsquo;s not a great piece of software, to be honest.  It&rsquo;s always stopped my Mac from rebooting properly, and recently it just stopped working for outgoing calls.  Groundwire is better for Android platforms.</p>

<h2 id="elaborate-customisations-for-terminals-shells-desktops">Elaborate customisations for terminals/shells/desktops</h2>

<p>Nah, more hassle than they&rsquo;re worth.  Bash works fine with a few aliases.</p>

<h2 id="stuff-that-isn-t-a-computer-or-software-but-might-be-but-you-know-what-i-mean">Stuff that isn&rsquo;t a computer or software but might be but you know what I mean</h2>

<p>Lots of things are computers now.  I know what a microcontroller/microprocessor is.  I know my phone/watch/bathroom scales/has more power than Apollo 11.  My bathroom scales once wished me happy birthday, and I knew tech had gone too far.</p>

<h2 id="headphones">Headphones</h2>

<p>Bose Quietcomfort 35 (QC35):  These have been my favourite purchase in the last five years.  They do indeed provide quiet, and they are indeed comfortable.  I use them during the commute to mitigate traffic and tube noise, at work to drown out the noise my colleagues make, and at home when I use a games console.  Battery life is great, sound quality is perfectly fine, and they are really comfortable.  Some people would balk at paying £300 for a pair of headphones, but the value they&rsquo;ve provided has meant it was worth it.</p>

<h2 id="yubikeys">Yubikeys</h2>

<p>I use Yubikeys wherever they&rsquo;re supported.  I particularly make sure they&rsquo;re enforced for LastPass, DropBox, and my Google accounts.  The Yubikey 4 is an amazing tool to protect yourself from malicious actors, and given none of us can be 100% certain we&rsquo;ll never have password stolen it&rsquo;s a worthwhile investment.  I keep one at home, just in case.  What&rsquo;s even nicer is that I can get them at a 50% discount through work.</p>

<h2 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h2>

<p>My important stuff lives here.  I know some will say I shouldn&rsquo;t trust cloud, but it&rsquo;s convenient and two-factor auth with a good password makes it safe enough for me.</p>

<h2 id="evernote">Evernote</h2>

<p>Evernote is a lovely note-taking application that I&rsquo;ve discussed above.</p>

<h2 id="spotify">Spotify</h2>

<p>£9.99 a month for all the music I want and loads of podcasts for the commute seems like a good deal to me.</p>

<h2 id="lastpass">Lastpass</h2>

<p>I could not function without a password manager.  The convenience of it means that I actually use a password manager.  There&rsquo;s no need to do the &lsquo;keep your passwords only ever in your personal, physical, custody&rsquo; thing.  1Password is a strong choice as well - I did try it but I&rsquo;ve become too used to Lastpass.</p>

<h2 id="openvpn-server">OpenVPN Server</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got an OpenVPN server running that connects me to home.  It&rsquo;s great to have access to a NAS at home, especially as 200Mbps download speed means backups are viable and file access is reasonable as long as you aren&rsquo;t wanting to transfer video or large datasets.  I even paid for the licence because I think it&rsquo;s a great project.</p>

<hr />

<p>That&rsquo;s it for work.  I use stuff for play, particularly in the home automation realm, but I think justifies another page to itself.</p>
